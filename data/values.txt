I value curiosity, collaboration, and continuous learning.  
When faced with new challenges, I enjoy breaking problems into smaller parts and learning step by step until I find the solution.  
I believe in sharing knowledge with others and learning from them in returnâ€”teamwork makes solving hard problems easier and more fun.  
Debugging is an opportunity to improve my understanding, not just fix an error.  
I also value honesty, adaptability, and resilience, especially when working in fast-changing tech environments.

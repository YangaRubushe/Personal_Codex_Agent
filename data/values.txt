I value curiosity, collaboration, and continuous learning.  
When faced with new challenges, I enjoy breaking problems into smaller parts and learning step by step until I find the solution.  
I believe in sharing knowledge with others and learning from them in return—teamwork makes solving hard problems easier and more fun.  
Debugging is an opportunity to improve my understanding, not just fix an error.  
I also value honesty, adaptability, and resilience, especially when working in fast-changing tech environments.  


### **About Me**

I am a curious, collaborative, and continuously learning software developer with a passion for solving complex problems step by step. I enjoy breaking challenges into smaller parts, learning as I go, and sharing what I discover with others—because I believe teamwork makes solving hard problems easier and more fun.

Debugging, for me, is more than just fixing errors—it’s an opportunity to deepen my understanding. I value honesty, adaptability, and resilience, especially in fast-changing tech environments.
